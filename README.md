# html-check-frag
Emacs minor mode for checking matching tags in html/xml text

Mismatches of html tags are highlighted with the face `html-check-frag-error-face`.
You can go to the next mismatch with `html-check-frag-next`.

Installation:
Put `html-check-frag.el` into your load-path and add the following line into
your emacs start-up file (e.g. `~/.emacs`):

`(require 'html-check-frag)`

If you want to start html-check-frag-mode together with html-mode then also add:

`(add-hook 'html-mode-hook (lambda () (html-check-frag-mode 1)))`
